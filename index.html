    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Sri Gaur Gopal Das’s philosophy out from his years of wisdom and thrusts
        it back where it belongs, in our daily lives, helping all of us
        approaching any problem with equanimity and poise. A kind of
        Spiritualistic manual for life, you will turn to it time and time again
        and learn to tear through any obstacle, resolve conflicts, forgive and
        value the relationships. An absolute must-read and I guarantee you that
        you’ll enjoy Gaur Gopal Das Ji’s sense of humour in every chapter as
        much as we cherish in his videos. There are four principles (wheels)
        that form the foundation of a happy life.

    <p>
        I came to know about Gaur Gopal Das Ji when I came across one of his
        videos on YouTube. I was really fascinated by his thoughts and her
        teachings. So, I researched books written by him and bought
        <em>Life’s Amazing </em>
        Secrets online from Amazon. I am really glad I did it because the
        insights, examples and the story are simple to understand and are
        life-changing if one truly understands the motive behind the same. So,
        in this book, Gaur Gopal Das Ji talks about the 4 principles that form
        the foundation of a happy life. These are Personal life, Relationships,
        Work life, and Social Contribution. He talks how to keep them balanced
        to live a life full of values and happiness.

    <h3>Review</h3>
    <p>
        Overall, it’s been a book that I can pick up anytime I feel low or out
        of balance. It’s written beautifully and presented well. The language is
        quite easy and it is neither fast-paced nor slow. I read this book in 2
        sittings as I was truly gripped by it and it wasn’t easy to put this
        down. So, I must say that it is quite engaging. I highly suggest you buy
        a Life’s Amazing Secrets. You won’t be disappointed at all.
